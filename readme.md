# Borpress

This is Wordpress fork which is meant to be sane.

Things I want to do:

- Analyze most popular plugins and combine them in one plugin to make one "core" plugin
- enahance security
- make it work fast with nginx 
- forbit all non-opensource plugins which have addons and bloatware, only free plugins, opensource are accepted
- Implement princpies real developers uses, like guys from Drupal, Laravel or Python community.
